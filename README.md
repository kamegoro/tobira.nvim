  tobira watches how you actually edit.<br>
  When it spots a pattern you could do better, it quietly shows you the one command that would have helped — right now, not someday.

No quizzes. No interruptions. Just your habits, and the better path.

## ✨ How it works

- **Watches your keystrokes passively** — no config required, zero impact on your mappings
- **Detects inefficient patterns** — repeated `f`, hammering `j`, `dw`→`i` instead of `cw`, and more
- **Suggests the one better command** — shown after a natural pause, up to `max_shown` times per session, with a cooldown between auto-suggestions
- **Tracks mastery by watching your behavior** — once you've used a command ~100 times, tobira stops suggesting it
- **Filters to your level** — beginner commands first, advanced ones once you're ready
- **136 commands in the learning graph** — motion, edit, search, window, fold, mark, and macro commands from the full Neovim index

## 📺 Guide panel

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/demo-guide.gif" alt=":TobiraGuide cheatsheet panel" width="720" />
</p>

`:TobiraGuide` opens a cheatsheet on the right side of the screen. Commands you've mastered show **✓** and reveal the next step with **→**. Covers all 7 categories: motion, edit, search, window, fold, mark, and macro. Shown automatically on first launch.

---

## 📊 Skill progress

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/demo-progress.gif" alt=":TobiraProgress skill tree" width="720" />
</p>

`:TobiraProgress` shows your current level and the full learning graph. Press `x` on any row to suppress a suggestion you don't want; press `x` again to restore it. Press `p` to pin a command so it always appears at the top of `:TobiraGuide`.

## ⚙️ Configuration

All options are optional — the defaults work out of the box.

```lua
require("tobira").setup({
  lang                = 'en',    -- 'en' | 'ja'
  idle_delay          = 1500,    -- ms of inactivity before showing an ambient suggestion
  idle_suggestions    = true,    -- enable ambient idle suggestions
  suggestion_cooldown = 300,     -- s between automatic suggestions (default: 5 min)
  max_shown           = 2,       -- max times to suggest the same command per session
})
```
